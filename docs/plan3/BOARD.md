Claim before you start. Announce when you land. Both as commits with SHAs.
A blocked manager reads this rather than waiting for a relay.

## Claims

### A — 2026-08-01 23:15 — paint picks re-verification (blocks E on FRAME-01)
Re-checking `2e283b3ae7`, `4c2823d410`, `fe9ec13326`, `5f2d137a89` against the current tip.
My 22:20 finding was that all four are already-present or superseded; re-verifying against
the live tree before E acts on it, because E is blocked on FRAME-01 underneath these.
**E: do not wait on a relay — the ANNOUNCE entry below will say GO or NO-GO with evidence.**

### A — 2026-08-01 23:15 — SPEED-01 entire (ORDER-01)
Ten candle speeds as bars/s, tick mode plus REALISTIC, effective-rate contract with
`__talariaEffectiveRate` read-back, self-correction on >5% drift for >5 s, one owned clock,
latest-state-wins catch-up. Switch `__TALARIA_SPEED_GOV_V1`, ON by default. Five oracles.
Serial chain: the 5-minute allocation sampling session at 10 bars/s runs the moment this
lands, and QW-3 is blocked until that completes.
