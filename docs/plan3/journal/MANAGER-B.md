# Manager B journal — Product Fix Families

**Append-only.** Corrections are new entries that supersede earlier ones by id; earlier entries are never edited or deleted.

## B-0001 — SESSION OPEN · 2026-07-27 23:47 (UTC+1)

Manager B session opened. Standing policy read in full before any other action: `DIRECTOR-RULINGS-20260727.md`, then `README.md`, `PLAN3-BOARD.md` (structure + my rows: M6, M15, M25, M26, M10/TAL-01896), `TICKETS-INTAKE-20260727.md`, `INTAKE-MERGE-20260727.md`.

Queue as received from the Director, in order:
1. Precondition audit on own territory — V6 call-site ownership (cheap tier, §A11.3).
2. Five V6 order-drag defects (M6).
3. V8 preference contract (M15) — timeframe pins, tool pins, pin-bar state.
4. M25 four REDs; M26 two REDs.
5. Trade-duration clock defect (TAL-01896); teardown residual.

Merge gate: authoring open from minute one; **no merge into integration until Manager C lands `TERRITORY.yml` + CI ownership preflight** (§A11.1). Verified at session open: no `TERRITORY.yml` exists anywhere in the repo, and `docs/plan3/journal/` did not exist (this file creates it). Gate is therefore **closed**; I author and do not merge, and I do not idle waiting.

Own worktree created off `main` @ `51b6e0da1740db9b384e61eef3fefbb771b0fc29` rather than working on the integration branch (§A11.1). The repository's default checkout is on `backlog/lane4-q4-path-cap` with a large uncommitted working set that is not mine; I touch none of it.

Outstanding `PO-REQ` count: **0**.

## B-0002 — PROVENANCE NOTE · standing policy changed during my read

`DIRECTOR-RULINGS-20260727.md` was **273 lines when I began reading it and 328 lines minutes later**. The added region is **§A13 "Managers dispatch, they do not implement" (PO directive, 2026-07-27 23:52)**, including §A13.1–§A13.4 (adversarial review at top tier, the model-routing table, parallel-subagent collision rules, mandatory brief contents).

Consequence, recorded because it changed my own conduct mid-session: my first pass missed §A13 through no fault of the Director. I re-read the file raw end-to-end and am operating under §A13 from this entry onward — I dispatch subagents and do not author product code myself; my own code reading is confined to the §A13 carve-out (reading in order to write a competent brief).

Standing request implied for the Director: when policy is amended mid-session, a one-line amendment marker would let managers detect it without re-reading 328 lines. Not an escalation, an observation.

---

## B-0003 — ASSUMPTION · model-routing reference resolves to §A13.2

The dispatch instruction cites "§Part 4 model routing"; §A13.1 likewise cites "§Part 4". **There is no §Part 4 in `DIRECTOR-RULINGS-20260727.md`** — the document is structured as Part A (§A1–§A13, §A5) and Part B (§B1–§B6). The only model-routing table in the corpus is **§A13.2**, and its content matches the Director's inline restatement exactly (cheap for audits/inventories, mid for implementing specced fixes, top for money-path/data-durability and root-cause triage, reviewer never downgraded).

**Assumption:** "§Part 4" is a stale cross-reference to **§A13.2**, which I treat as the operative routing policy. Routing recorded per dispatch. If the Director intends a different document, correct me and I will re-route in flight.

Corollary held as fact from §A13.2, not assumed: default tier is cheap (`composer-2.5-fast`, `cursor-grok-4.5-medium-fast`); escalation trigger is **verifiability, not apparent difficulty**; `opus 4.7` does not exist and is never substituted silently.

---

## B-0004 — ESCALATION (policy gap) · "§Part 6 standard" for the agent smoke sweep does not exist

§A12.3 makes this binding: *"No `PO-REQ` may be emitted until the packet's automated gates and the agent smoke sweep are green (§Part 6 standard)."* **There is no §Part 6 in the rulings corpus**, and a repository-wide search finds "Part 6" only in an unrelated analytics handoff document.

This is a real gate I cannot satisfy or self-define, and it sits directly in front of every `PO-REQ` I will need for V6 and V8 reporter re-verification. Per my operating rules I escalate rather than locally interpret.

**Ask:** either name the document that defines the agent smoke sweep standard, or state the standard in one paragraph. **Not blocking now** (I have no gate-green packet yet, so no `PO-REQ` is due); it becomes blocking at my first V6 packet. I continue working.

---

## B-0005 — VERDICT · V6 territory precondition (§A11.3): order-line paint, hit-testing and drag preview

surface=`source (repository working tree, branch backlog/lane4-q4-path-cap @ 634448817)` · coverage=`static call-site enumeration of chart.js + chart/modules/*.js; NOT verified on a served build, NOT verified on panel/iframe surface, no runtime binding check`

**Verdict: the V6 implementation is owned by `order-manager.js` (mine). Its invalidation/scheduling and its z-order referee are not. V6 is grantable to Manager B with three named seams that need a Director ruling.**

### Owned by me — implementation (`chart v 1.4/chart/modules/order-manager.js`, 49,672 lines)

| V6 concern | Site | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Order-line paint | `drawOrderLine()` @ 36214 | per-order line render |
| Order-line paint | `updateOrderLines()` @ 44563 | bulk reposition/purge/rebuild; the entry point everything else calls |
| Preview-line paint | `drawPreviewLine()` @ 22706 | creates visible `line` + invisible `hitLine` + `labelGroup` |
| Hit-target geometry | `drawPreviewLine()` @ 22729, 22747–22758 | `hitStrokeWidth = 20`, `pointer-events: stroke` when draggable |
| Hit-order priority | `_raiseEntryAnchoredPreviewBadgesToFront()` @ 22673 | lifts entry/avg-entry/SL/TP/multi-TP badge groups to top of SVG stack |
| Coincident-level stacking | `_multiEntryStackYOffsetPx()` @ 25360, `_computeMultiEntryStackIndices`, `ENTRY_STACK_OFFSET_PX` | **multi-entry legs only** |
| Multi-TP badge fan | `_drawMultiTPPreviewBadges()` @ 23897 | fans by index (`5px` X, `3px` Y) for *unset* targets at entry price |
| Drag + drag preview | all **7** `d3.drag()` registrations @ 22940, 23945, 24024, 26251, 35619, 37850, 38801 | zero order drag handlers exist outside this file |
| Drag-time recompute | `calculateAdvancedRiskReward()` @ 23013/23262/23457/23525; `updatePlaceButtonText()` @ 23409, 23739–23746 | see the deferral finding below |
| Drag freeze flag | `isDraggingPreviewLine` — 25 sites, notably @ 1368, 1383, 25352, 25983, 28446 | suppresses `updatePreviewLines()` during drag |

`chart.js` contains **no** order-line paint, hit-test or drag implementation: a search for order/SL/TP-named functions returns exactly one unrelated match (`isMacChartPlatform`), and it registers exactly one `d3.drag()` (@ 40966, not an order path).

### Seam 1 — invalidation and scheduling live in `chart.js` (Manager A)

`chart.js` decides *when* my paint runs, and owns the kill-switches for it:
- `_syncOrderOverlaysDuringPan(panActive)` @ 28594 — the pan-lite path. Chooses between `om.updateOrderLines(this, { panLite: true, skipTradeMarkers: true })` @ 28647 and a full `om.updateOrderLines(this)` @ 28671, then calls `om.updatePreviewLinePositions()`, `om._updateEntryMarkersForChart()`, `om._updateExitAndPartialMarkersOnMain()`, `om.updateMfeMaeMarkers()`, `om._scheduleDraftPreviewRedrawIfNeeded()`.
- Kill-switches declared and read in `chart.js`, not mine: `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_OVERLAY_PAN_LITE_V1`, `__TALARIA_DISABLE_TRADE_MARKER_LIVE_PAN_GLUE_V1`, `__TALARIA_DISABLE_TRADE_MARKER_CANONICAL_PROJECTION_V1`.
- `render()` tail @ 29500–29514 — the post-scale repaint call, gated on `chartViewPanning`.

**Why this matters for defect 1 (lines disappearing while moving/after placement):** if the mechanism is *when* repaint is invoked or which lite path is selected mid-gesture, the cure is in `chart.js` and is **A's**, not mine. If it is what `updateOrderLines()` does when invoked (purge-then-rebuild ordering, registry vs DOM divergence), it is mine. The two are distinguishable by diagnostic and I have routed that triage to top tier rather than guessing — the in-file comments at 28600–28614 record that this exact path already produced two prior "froze until mouse-up" defects, so the prior is genuinely split.

### Seam 2 — the z-order contest is refereed by two files I do not own

Hit-order priority when lines overlap is decided by three parties:
- mine: `_raiseEntryAnchoredPreviewBadgesToFront()` (order-manager @ 22673),
- **`modules/drawing-tools-manager.js`**: `raiseDrawingLayersAboveOrderPreviews()` @ 8280, called @ 8262, 12850, 12921 — deliberately lifts drawing layers *above* order previews, which my function then re-raises against. My own source comment @ 22688–22692 documents that losing this contest swallows the multi-entry ✓/✕ clicks outright.
- **`chart.js`**: `updateSVGPointerEvents()` @ 37678 — I call it from 8 sites in order-manager; it decides whether the root SVG captures at all.

`drawing-tools-manager.js` is **assigned to no manager** in my brief or in the `INTAKE-MERGE-20260727.md` §3 matrix. It also **writes order state directly**: `orderManager.orderLines = orderManager.orderLines.filter(...)` at 12088, 12097 and 12133 — a foreign module mutating my registry.

### Seam 3 — `order-manager.js` is co-claimed by M23/M24 (Lane 5)

`INTAKE-MERGE-20260727.md` §3 grants Lane 5 exclusive write on `order-manager.js` for M23/M24, and the recorded V6 blocker is verbatim *"Lane5 order-manager.js exclusive ownership"* (see B-0006). The Director has now granted the same file to me, and separately told me M24's ledger migration is live and that I am the only manager permitted to author migrations, strictly serialised. I read those together as: **the Lane-5 grant is superseded and M24's `order-manager.js` work now flows through me and is serialised by me.** That reading is load-bearing and it is an inference, so it is filed as an assumption in B-0007, not acted on as fact.

### What I am NOT doing

Not editing `chart.js`, `drawing-tools-manager.js`, or any shell to make a V6 fix possible. Where the cure lands outside my territory I will report it and stop, per instruction.

---

## B-0006 — EVIDENCE FOUND · V6 already has PO evidence; V8 already has a RED

Neither artefact is on `main`; both were located on sibling worktree commits and are not in the docs tree. Recording them so no one re-runs them.

**V6 — `docs/plan3/PO-V6-PARTIAL-20260727.evidence.json`** on `24ea0eabb` (2026-07-27 12:08, build **B75**, lineage `ACCEPTED_PO_SWEEP`, result **PARTIAL**, `productEditsAuthorized: false`, blocker "Lane5 order-manager.js exclusive ownership", `overClosureProhibited: true`, `screenshotSha256: REQUIRED_PENDING`). Matrix maps cleanly onto the Director's five defects:

| Cell | Result | Observation | Maps to |
|---|---|---|---|
| A, F | RED | joint current-build line visibility (TAL-01696, TAL-01698) | lines disappearing; SL/TP not fully visible |
| B | RED | entry-dependent SL/TP recompute (TAL-01697 scenario PASS) | SL/TP not updating until release |
| C | RED | label overlap + cross-order disambiguation — **`poQuestion: PENDING`** | overlapping TP boxes |
| D, E | PASS | order drag scenario; TAL-01699 blocker | — |
| G | RED | release-gated preview, **broader than TAL-01617** | preview calc not updating until release |

Dispositions to honour: TAL-01697 `SCENARIO_PASS_NO_OVER_CLOSE`, TAL-01699 `BLOCKER_PASS_NO_OVER_CLOSE`, TAL-01897/TAL-01750 `CLOSE_PENDING_REPORTER_CONFIRMATION`, **TAL-01885 `STALE_SURFACE_TRIAGE_SURVIVED_REENTER_ENGINEERING`** (stale-surface triage already run and survived — this is real engineering, not a retest), TAL-01617 `OPEN_BROADER_RELEASE_GATED_RED`. Cell C carries an unanswered PO question; I will not invent its answer.

**V8 — `tests/evidence/b70-stage5/b75-po-v8-owner-pins-red.mjs`** + `.test.mjs` on `b925f7d2d` (2026-07-27 12:12, "diagnose owner pin persistence red"). It already establishes the mechanism, and it establishes that **V8 is not inside my territory**:
- Pin state is `useState` with hardcoded defaults in **`chart v 1.4/talaria-design/src/TalariaV8bLive.jsx`** — `toolPinned` (`Trend Line, Horizontal Line, Fib Retracement, Rectangle, Text`), `tfPinned` (`1m, 5m, 15m, 1H, 4H, 1D`), `pinnedBarOpen: false`, `pinnedBarPos: {x:50,y:80}`. `runLifecycleMatrix()` records the sharpest line in the harness: apparent account isolation is **"remount-to-default, not owner-scoped persistence."**
- Owner identity bootstraps in **`chart v 1.4/talaria-design/live/index.html`** — a servable shell — with `window.userStorage` shim created *synchronously* while `/api/auth/me` resolves *asynchronously*, plus a cached `localStorage['_uid']` and a late `window.__talariaUserId` fallback. That is precisely the §A4 "empty or failed read is never authoritative" hazard, in the shell.
- Backend members probed in `journal-backend/routes/chart_routes.py` + `models.py`: `timeframe_favorites` exists; `tool_pins` and `pin_bar` are probed as possibly absent.

---

## B-0007 — ASSUMPTIONS · unverified premises I am proceeding on

Each is unverified, each would change my plan if false, none is treated as fact.

- **B-0007a** Lane 5's exclusive-write grant on `order-manager.js` (`INTAKE-MERGE-20260727.md` §3) is superseded by my grant, and M24 ledger-migration work on that file is now mine to author and serialise. *If false, V6 is blocked exactly as it was at 12:08 today and the Director should say so.*
- **B-0007b** "M25's four REDs" and "M26's two" mean authoring failing tests that encode those rows' member scenarios, not editing `replay-system.js` or `chart.js`. Board: M25 = `replay-system.js` tick/step + replay clock (Lane 2, 4 members after the PO scratched TAL-01854); M26 = `chart.js` viewport/interaction (Lane 1, **5** members, "SERIALIZED BEHIND B74", "MUST NOT open before the B74 integration branch lands"). Both product surfaces are explicitly outside my territory, and test harnesses belong to Manager C. See the escalation in B-0008.
- **B-0007c** The V6 evidence at `24ea0eabb` is still current for build B75 and no later V6 run supersedes it. Its `screenshotSha256` is `REQUIRED_PENDING`, so the visual record is incomplete.
- **B-0007d** `drawing-tools-manager.js` has no current writer, so its 3 direct writes to `orderManager.orderLines` are not being changed underneath me.
- **B-0007e** TEST-2 exists and satisfies the §B5 database-isolation condition. An `infra/test2-profile` worktree exists, which suggests it was stood up; I have not verified DB isolation and will not deploy until I have.

---

## B-0008 — ESCALATION (territory) · four rows in my queue are not in my territory

Reported, not decided. I am not touching any of these files, and I am not idling — I am working V6 and the V8 persistence half meanwhile.

1. **M25 (four REDs)** — product surface is `replay-system.js` (replay tick/step generator + replay clock). My brief forbids `replay-system.js` and the data pipeline. Board assigns it to Lane 2. **Ask:** does my M25 scope mean RED authoring only, and if so, why is it not Manager C's (harnesses/oracles/CI are C's)?
2. **M26 (two REDs)** — product surface is `chart.js` viewport/interaction, Manager A's exclusive territory, and the board marks the row SERIALIZED BEHIND B74 with an explicit must-not-open. The board lists **5** members, not two. **Ask:** which two, and same RED-ownership question as M25.
3. **Teardown residual (~230 MB)** — §A1 item 4 defines it as *"Workstream-A retained-set hygiene (view/listener/cache release on panel destroy)"* in a parallel lane. Panel destroy is A's surface. I can own the order-side retained set (order-manager listeners, marker registries, series caches) and nothing else. **Ask:** confirm my slice is order-side only.
4. **V8 preference contract** — splits across three owners and I hold only one part. Mine: the persistence engine in `preferences-init.js` / `preferences-sync.js`. Not mine: the React pin state in `talaria-design/src/TalariaV8bLive.jsx`, and the owner-identity bootstrap in `talaria-design/live/index.html`, which is a **servable shell** and therefore explicitly A's. Also unassigned: the `journal-backend` preference members. **Ask:** either move the pin-state call sites to me, or assign A the React/shell half against a contract I author. I will author the owner-scoped contract and its RED regardless, since that half is unambiguously mine and is the part the PO's spec actually rests on.

Plus, from B-0005: **`drawing-tools-manager.js` is unassigned** yet it both contests order-preview z-order (`raiseDrawingLayersAboveOrderPreviews`) and writes `orderManager.orderLines` directly at three sites. V6's overlapping-TP/hit-priority defect cannot be closed with coverage while a file nobody owns can re-order my layers and mutate my registry. **Ask:** assign it, or rule that the seam is mine to define and A's to honour.

---

## B-0009 — RESERVATIONS · claimed before any dispatch (§A13.3)

Reserved now so parallel briefs cannot collide. Unused reservations will be released in a later entry rather than silently reused.

**Kill-switch globals** (default-ON cures, switch-OFF must be a demonstrated cell per §B3, not merely declared):
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_SLTP_ENTRY_DRAG_FOLLOW_V2` — SL/TP follow the entry live during entry drag (V6 defect 2 / cell B / TAL-01653).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_PREVIEW_LIVE_RECALC_V1` — preview/RR/qty recompute every drag frame instead of on release (V6 defect 5 / cell G / TAL-01617, TAL-01697).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_TP_COINCIDENT_STACK_V1` — coincident-TP stacking + hit disambiguation (V6 defect 3 / cell C / TAL-01699).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_LINE_EDGE_VISIBILITY_V1` — full-visibility clamp for SL/TP lines and labels at plot edges (V6 defect 4 / TAL-01885).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_LINE_DRAG_PERSIST_V1` — order lines survive move/placement (V6 defect 1 / cells A, F / TAL-01696, TAL-01698, TAL-01789).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_PREF_OWNER_SCOPED_PINS_V1` — owner-scoped pin persistence (V8 / M15 / TAL-01792, TAL-01895).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_TRADE_DURATION_CLOCK_V1` — trade-duration clock (TAL-01896).
- `__TALARIA_DISABLE_ORDER_TEARDOWN_RELEASE_V1` — order-side retained-set release on teardown.

**Global symbols:** `window.TalariaPreferences` (facade published by `preferences-init.js`), `window.__TALARIA_PREF_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `window.__TALARIA_LOADED_MODULES` entry name `TalariaPreferences` (the §A4c-3 presence channel; the array itself is C's/A's contract, I reserve only my member name).

**Storage keys** — per-key writes only, never a blob (§A4 guardrail 1), tier encoded in the key so a layout can never rewrite a user preference (§A4 tier 2), schema version in the prefix (§A4 guardrail 3):
- `tal.pref.v1.u.<accountId>.pins.timeframes`
- `tal.pref.v1.u.<accountId>.pins.tools`
- `tal.pref.v1.u.<accountId>.pinbar.open`
- `tal.pref.v1.u.<accountId>.pinbar.pos`
- `tal.pref.v1.meta.schemaVersion`
- Legacy keys to be read-migrated and retained one full release cycle per §A4 (lazy migration on read): `v9_tool_pinned`, `v9_tf_pinned`, `v9_pinned_bar`, `toolPinned`, `tfPinned`, `pinnedBarOpen`, `pinnedBarPos`. **Not reserved — pre-existing**, listed so no one treats them as free.
- Reset-to-defaults entry point reachable without loading the chart (§A4 guardrail 6): URL param `?talPrefReset=1`.

**Message names** (panels are iframes, so these cross frames): `talaria:pref:set`, `talaria:pref:changed`, `talaria:pref:request-snapshot`.

Note on `<accountId>`: preferences are keyed to account id and must remain excludable from customer data per I16 (§A4 first line). No account id is embedded in any evidence artefact; QA account ids only.

---

## B-0010 — DISPATCH · read-only audits, cheap tier, parallel (§A13.2, §A13.3)

Read-only subagents cannot collide, so parallelism is unlimited. Neither may write any file.

- **B-A1** — V6 call-site ownership audit, independent of B-0005. Tier **cheap** (`composer-2.5-fast`) per §A13.2 row 1 (audits, file:line inventories); the verifier is my own independent enumeration in B-0005, so an undetected error is caught, which is the §A13.2 escalation test. Writable file set: **none**.
- **B-A2** — V8 preference-state and storage-key inventory across React source, servable shells, chart modules and `journal-backend`. Tier **cheap** (`composer-2.5-fast`), same row. Verifier: the existing V8 RED at `b925f7d2d`. Writable file set: **none**.

Per §A13.2, cheap-tier output is evidence only — no classification or verdict from these subagents enters the record. Every verdict in this journal is mine, with `surface=` and `coverage=`.

Write packets in flight: **0 of 3** (§A13.3 cap). Outstanding `PO-REQ` count: **0**.

---

## B-0011 — ESCALATION (provenance) · the standing policy documents are not version-controlled

Found while committing this journal. `.gitignore:24` ignores `docs/`. Of everything under `docs/plan3/`, exactly **45 paths are tracked** (force-added historically) and the only tracked markdown at the top level is `PLAN3-BOARD.md`. The following are **untracked and ignored**, i.e. they have no git history, no diff, no blame, and no provenance:

- `docs/plan3/DIRECTOR-RULINGS-20260727.md` — the standing policy that binds all three managers
- `docs/plan3/README.md`
- `docs/plan3/INTAKE-MERGE-20260727.md`
- `docs/plan3/TICKETS-INTAKE-20260727.md`
- `docs/plan3/STICKY-REGISTRY.md`
- `docs/plan3/PO-SWEEP-RESULTS-20260727.md`

This is the mechanical explanation of B-0002. §A13 was added to the rulings while I was reading them and there was **no way to detect it except noticing that the file's line count had changed from 273 to 328**, because there is no commit to diff. A manager cannot verify which version of policy it is bound by, cannot cite a policy revision in a packet, and cannot detect an amendment mid-flight.

It also undercuts D-034 in its own terms: this programme requires a provenance chain for every byte it ships, while the document defining that requirement is the one artefact with no provenance chain at all.

**Ask (cheap, and I am not the right owner):** force-add the plan-3 governance markdown to git, or add a `!docs/plan3/**/*.md` negation to `.gitignore`. Either makes policy amendments diffable and citable. This is tooling and repository hygiene, which is Manager C's charter, so I am not doing it inside my territory — I am reporting it. My own journal is force-added to git in the same commit as this entry, following the existing convention for tracked files under `docs/`.

**Not blocking.** Recorded because a governance system whose governance is untracked will produce a disputed instruction eventually, and it is far cheaper to fix now than to adjudicate later.

---

## B-0012 — DISPATCH · B-A3, trade-duration clock and order-side retained set (read-only, cheap)

Dispatched to keep working while B-A1 and B-A2 are in flight (§A11.1: never idle). Read-only, so it cannot collide with them.

**B-A3** — locate the trade-duration computation for TAL-01896 ("wrong duration in all-trades", an M10 member the Director queued to me, and the §B3 calibration example for Tier 1), and separately inventory the order-side retained set: order-manager timers, listeners, marker registries and series caches that are not released on teardown. Tier **cheap** (`composer-2.5-fast`) per §A13.2 rows 1–2 (inventories, timer/listener census). Writable file set: **none**.

The teardown half is deliberately scoped to the order side only, because §A1 item 4 defines the ~230 MB teardown residual as Workstream-A panel-destroy hygiene, which is not my territory (see B-0008 item 3). I am inventorying my own contribution to it and nothing else.

Write packets in flight: **0 of 3**. Outstanding `PO-REQ` count: **0**.

## B-0013 — SELF-CORRECTION · two defects in my own §A13 compliance

§A13 re-issued to all managers 2026-07-28 00:08. Re-read in full against source. No change to my operating posture — B-0002/B-0003 already recorded it and I have authored nothing — but re-reading it against my own three dispatches surfaced two defects in my compliance, both mine, both recorded here rather than quietly fixed.

**Defect 1 — brief form.** §A13.4 requires every brief to state *"task, tier and model with the reason for that tier, the exact file set the subagent may write, names already reserved for it, the acceptance criterion, and what it must report back."* B-A1/B-A2/B-A3 each stated the task, the writable file set (`NONE`, in the first two lines), the acceptance criterion as a mandated output format, and the report-back. **None of them stated the tier, the model, or the reason for the tier inside the brief itself** — I recorded that in B-0010/B-0012 instead. The brief is the artefact that gets checked, so putting the routing rationale only in my journal is not compliance.

Not invalid under the §A13.4 invalidity test, which turns specifically on the writable file set, and all three declared `NONE`. Not re-dispatched: they are read-only, so no naming collision and no territory risk is possible, and re-running them would burn tokens to fix a form defect with zero substantive effect. **Every brief from B-0017 onward carries the routing block.** Template of record appended below.

**Defect 2 — reservations incomplete.** §A13.3 requires reserving *"kill-switch names, global symbols, storage keys, message names, oracle and fixture names"* before dispatch. B-0009 reserved the first four and **omitted oracle and fixture names entirely**. That gap has teeth: the §B3 provenance floor makes a regression test part of every packet, so every write packet I dispatch will create oracle and fixture names, and two parallel briefs could have collided on them. Closed in B-0014 before any write packet is dispatched.

### Brief template of record (Manager B)

Every write and read brief I issue from now states, in this order: **task** · **tier + model + the §A13.2 row and escalation-trigger reason** · **exact writable file set, enumerated, or `NONE`** · **names reserved for this brief** (from B-0009/B-0014, quoted, with "invent no new names; if you need one, stop and report") · **acceptance criterion** · **what to report back** · **explicit prohibitions** (files it may not touch, and "do not weaken or remove a gate, guard or kill-switch to make a test pass").

## B-0014 — RESERVATIONS supplement · oracle and fixture names (closes B-0013 defect 2)

Reserved before any write dispatch. Naming grammar: `b-<row>-<concern>-<kind>`.

**Oracles / REDs:**
- `b-m6-sltp-entry-drag-follow.red.mjs` — SL/TP track the entry live during entry drag (V6 defect 2).
- `b-m6-preview-live-recalc.red.mjs` — RR / position size / PnL / place-button recompute per drag frame, not on release (V6 defect 5).
- `b-m6-tp-coincident-stack.red.mjs` — two TPs at one price remain individually addressable (V6 defect 3).
- `b-m6-line-edge-visibility.red.mjs` — SL/TP line and label fully within the plot at both edges (V6 defect 4).
- `b-m6-line-drag-persist.red.mjs` — order lines survive move and placement (V6 defect 1).
- `b-m15-owner-scoped-pins.red.mjs` — pins survive refresh, exit/re-entry and new session, per owner (V8).
- `b-m10-trade-duration-clock.red.mjs` — trade duration (TAL-01896).
- `b-order-teardown-release.red.mjs` — order-side retained-set release.

**Negative-control cells** (§A5-1, paired kill-switch-OFF cells asserting RED): same basename with `.negctl.mjs`.

**Fixtures:** `b-fixtures/m6-two-tp-coincident.json`, `b-fixtures/m6-entry-drag-sltp.json`, `b-fixtures/m6-edge-price-extremes.json`, `b-fixtures/m15-pin-lifecycle-matrix.json`, `b-fixtures/m10-duration-replay-vs-wallclock.json`.

Fixtures carry **no** wall-clock timestamps, UUIDs, rAF ordering or float equality inside assertion payloads (§A5-6), and **no** real account ids (I16); QA account ids only.

Naming caveat, flagged not decided: test-harness and CI *placement* is Manager C's charter. I reserve these names and will have my packets' REDs authored, but where the files physically land and how they enter CI is C's call. If C wants a different path or grammar, the names move and I re-record them here.

## B-0015 — VERDICT · my whole V6 queue is one file, so §A13.3 serialises it; write partition and packet plan

surface=`source (branch manager-b/plan3-20260727 @ e096b1ff2, base main 51b6e0da1)` · coverage=`static; derived from the B-0005 call-site inventory and the B-0006 V6 evidence matrix. Not verified on a served build. Mechanism attribution for defect 1 is explicitly NOT covered and is out for triage.`

**The structural fact:** all five V6 defects, and M24's ledger migration, live in `order-manager.js`. §A13.3 states *"two subagents may never hold the same file"* and *"same-file work is serialised, never merged optimistically."* Therefore **the three-packet cap never binds me on V6 — the file binds first, at one packet at a time.** Five defects plus a live ledger migration through a single 49,672-line file is a one-lane road, and that is a throughput fact the Director should price rather than discover at a train boundary. Escalated in B-0016.

**Write partition inside my territory** (I am accountable for it per §A13.3). Three disjoint lanes, so my genuine parallelism ceiling is 3, and it is reached only when work exists in all three:

| Lane | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|
| α | `order-manager.js` | **serialised, one packet at a time** — V6 ×5 and M24's migration all queue here |
| β | `preferences-init.js`, `preferences-sync.js` | free — V8 engine half lands here, parallel to α |
| γ | `order-service.js`, `order-event-bus.js`, `indicator-persist-rehydrate.js` | free |

**V6 decomposition — grouped by mechanism, not by ticket,** because grouping is the only lever that shortens a serial queue without breaking the one-writer rule. Five defects become three packets and one blocked item:

- **V6-P1 — deferred-until-release recompute** (defects 2 and 5; evidence cells B and G; TAL-01653, TAL-01697, TAL-01617). One mechanism: work is skipped during drag and run at `'end'`. The `isDraggingPreviewLine` freeze flag (25 sites) and the guarded block at `order-manager.js:23528–23604` are the same shape, and `updatePlaceButtonText()` is called per-frame at only one site (23409) against three at drag-end (23739–23746). **Tier 3 / top tier (`claude-opus-5-thinking-high`).** Reason, as a stated trigger and not a difficulty judgement: these two defects decide *the numbers a trade is placed on* — SL/TP prices and risk-derived position size — which is money-path under §B3 and D-030 per the board's own M6 note; and **no existing oracle asserts painted preview values**, so an undetected error is expensive and unverified, which is exactly §A13.2's escalation trigger. Lane α, first.
- **V6-P2 — plot-edge visibility** (defect 4; TAL-01885, disposition `STALE_SURFACE_TRIAGE_SURVIVED_REENTER_ENGINEERING`, so this is engineering and not a retest). Clamp geometry is `Math.max(0, Math.min(chartHeight, event.y))` at 23025 and repeated at 23073/23088/23106, with label translate at 23188. **Tier 2 / mid tier (`gpt-5.5-medium-fast`).** Reason: fully speccable leaf-file change, and its RED is a deterministic geometry assertion, so the gate does the quality work — §A13.2 says stay cheap when that is true. Lane α, second.
- **V6-P3 — coincident-TP addressability** (defect 3; TAL-01699; evidence cell C). **BLOCKED on a spec answer, see B-0016.** Mechanism is already located: a stacking mechanism exists but only for multi-*entry* legs sharing a price (`_multiEntryStackYOffsetPx` @ 25360, `ENTRY_STACK_OFFSET_PX`), while multi-TP badges fan only by index for *unset* targets at the entry price (`_drawMultiTPPreviewBadges` @ 23897). There is no coincident-*TP* equivalent. What the fix should *do* when two TPs occupy one price — offset, cycle on repeat click, or something else — is a product decision I may not make.
- **V6-P4 — lines disappearing** (defect 1; cells A and F; TAL-01696, TAL-01698, TAL-01789). **Cannot be packeted until attribution is settled**, because the cure may sit in `chart.js`'s invalidation path (Manager A) rather than in mine — B-0005 seam 1. Root-cause triage dispatched as B-0017. Deliberately read-only, so it takes no lane and blocks nothing.

Every packet gets a separate top-tier adversarial review subagent (`claude-opus-5-thinking-high`) that did not author it, reconciled by me (§A13.1). Reviewers are never downgraded regardless of the authoring tier.

## B-0016 — ESCALATION · one throughput ruling and one spec question

**(a) `order-manager.js` is a single-lane road for V6 and M24 simultaneously.** Per B-0015 the file serialises five V6 defects and a live ledger migration. I have already compressed five defects into three packets by grouping on mechanism; beyond that I cannot parallelise without violating §A13.3, and I will not. Three options exist and all three are the Director's to pick, not mine: accept serial throughput on lane α; give M24's migration an explicit slot in my serial order so it is scheduled rather than colliding; or authorise a structural split of a 49,672-line file, which is architecture, top tier, and a large blast radius I would not recommend mid-flight while a ledger migration is live. **My default absent a ruling:** V6-P1 → V6-P2 → M24 migration slot → V6-P3/P4 as they unblock, with the V8 engine running in lane β in parallel throughout. I proceed on that default and will re-order on one line from you.

**(b) V6 evidence cell C carries `poQuestion: PENDING` and I cannot invent the answer.** The question is what should happen when two take-profits occupy the same price: separate them visually by an offset, keep them coincident but cycle selection on repeated clicks, or refuse the duplicate at entry. This is a product decision.

Filed as **`NEEDS-PO-CLARIFY`**, not as a `PO-REQ`, and the distinction is deliberate: §A12.2's `PO-REQ` template is verification-shaped — surface, URL, build ID, numbered steps, a stated prediction the PO confirms — and a spec question has no build to confirm and no prediction to test. `README.md` §Intake protocol item 3 already defines `NEEDS-PO-CLARIFY` as the channel for exactly this, and it explicitly *"never blocks other rows in the same lane"*, which is why V6-P1 and V6-P2 proceed ahead of it. If the Director wants spec questions carried as `PO-REQ` anyway, say so and I will re-file. **This is the reason my outstanding `PO-REQ` count is 0 and not 1.**

## B-0017 — DISPATCH · B-T1, root-cause triage of "order lines disappear while moving" (read-only, TOP tier)

**Task:** attribute V6 defect 1 to a mechanism and name the owning file, distinguishing "what `updateOrderLines()` produces when invoked" (mine) from "when and how `chart.js` invokes it mid-gesture" (Manager A's, per B-0005 seam 1).

**Tier / model:** **top** — `claude-opus-5-thinking-high`. §A13.2 row *"root-cause triage of any surprise or new regression"*. The escalation trigger is met on its own terms: a wrong attribution here sends the packet to the wrong manager's territory, and **no automatic verifier catches a mis-attribution** — it surfaces as a rejected packet or, worse, as an edit in someone else's territory. Cheap tier is correct where a gate converts a mistake into a rejection; there is no such gate for ownership attribution.

**Writable file set: NONE.** Read-only. Takes no lane, so it blocks nothing and can run beside the three cheap audits.

**Names reserved for it:** none — it writes nothing. It must invent no kill-switch, oracle or fixture names; if it believes one is needed it reports the need and I reserve it.

**Acceptance criterion:** a mechanism stated as a causal chain with file:line at every step, an explicit verdict of `order-manager.js` / `chart.js` / `both`, and — required — the discriminating observation that would distinguish the two attributions on a live build, so the attribution is falsifiable rather than argued.

Write packets in flight: **0 of 3**. Read-only subagents in flight: **4** (B-A1, B-A2, B-A3, B-T1). Outstanding `PO-REQ` count: **0**. Outstanding `NEEDS-PO-CLARIFY`: **1** (V6 cell C).
